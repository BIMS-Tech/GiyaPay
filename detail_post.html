                    <h1><strong>E-commerce &amp; the “New Normal”</strong></h1>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p>2020 – a year filled with uncertainty, adversity, and surprises. All industries suffered massive
                        losses, adjusted to ever-shifting consumer needs, and confronted both the ugly and inspiring
                        sides of change<em>. </em>Despite these, humanity has proven one thing: when push comes to
                        shove, we do what we must to adjust. One of the biggest changes this year has been the (close
                        to) complete transition into e-commerce. Most people who have access to stable internet
                        connection and working gadgets have dabbled in online shopping, whether as a consumer or as a
                        product or service provider.</p>
                    <p>With a few swipes and clicks, orders are placed, shipping details are finalized, and in a matter
                        of days, your items arrive right at your doorstep. However, is the full transaction
                        <em>really</em> that simple? Fortunately for consumers, it is. For providers, it is a different
                        story.</p>
                    <p><strong>Online Payments: What is it really like for providers?</strong></p>
                    <p>In general, online payments follow these steps:</p>
                    <ol role="list">
                        <li>A cashless transaction is made by the consumer via <strong>e-wallet, debit card, or credit
                                card.</strong></li>
                        <li>Payment details are verified by a <strong>payment gateway.</strong></li>
                        <li>Payment is wired to a <strong>merchant account.</strong></li>
                        <li>Payment is transferred into the <strong>merchant’s official bank account</strong>.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This process can seem technical, confusing, and intimidating – especially for providers who are
                        trying their hand at e-commerce for the first time. To explain further:</p>
                    <p><strong>Cashless transactions </strong>are all payment methods that do not involve actual cash
                        and/or cheques. Hence, they include e-wallets, debit cards, and credit cards – the safest and
                        most convenient payment methods.</p>
                    <p><strong>Payment gateways </strong>are basically security measures – they verify consumer
                        information (to ensure there is no fraudulent activity), then they either process or decline
                        each transaction. If for example, a consumer has insufficient funds linked to his or her credit
                        card, the payment gateway will decline the transaction completely. This gateway is also a highly
                        secure network, since it verifies sensitive and highly confidential consumer information.
                        Although this process seems lengthy, it all happens within a number of seconds.</p>
                    <p><strong>Merchant accounts. </strong>Here lies the tricky, grueling, and tedious part for
                        providers who offer online payment options. Merchant accounts are set up for both security and
                        monitoring purposes. Each merchant account has a unique <strong>merchant identification number
                            (MID)</strong> that identifies <em>every </em>online retailer and ensures that all their
                        transactions are routed through the proper networks. This makes fraudulent activity less likely
                        and easier to track in the case that it does happen – a win-win situation for both providers and
                        consumers. However, getting a merchant account entails further steps:</p>
                    <ol role="list">
                        <li>Providers first need an <strong>acquiring bank</strong> that will process consumers’
                            payments for them.</li>
                        <li>Then, providers also need a secure <strong>payment gateway</strong> that will verify
                            consumers’ account information and eventually allow the payments to be transferred into the
                            merchant account.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Getting both an approved acquiring bank <em>and </em>payment gateway are rigorous application
                        processes that may take several days or weeks, which may discourage providers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Is There an Easier Process for Merchants?</strong></p>
                    <p>With the rapid growth of e-commerce, there <em>must</em> be a more convenient way to offer
                        consumers online payment options, while still assuring the safety and security measures offered
                        by a merchant account. This is where <strong>payment integrators </strong>come in. A payment
                        integrator facilitates quick, easy, and efficient processing of sub-merchant accounts for
                        <em>all </em>types of businesses – whether you manage an established business, SME, government
                        unit, or educational institution, payment integrators provide the best solution, so that you can
                        offer any and every payment option to your consumers.</p>
                    <p><strong>How Do Payment Integrators Work?</strong></p>
                    <p>Recall the intricacies and importance of owning a merchant account – with a payment integrator,
                        providers are enrolled in a <strong>sub-merchant account </strong>that is part of the payment
                        integrator’s <strong>master merchant account</strong>. As a provider, you will only need to send
                        application and verification documents – the acquiring bank, payment gateway, and other tedious
                        processes are taken care of by the payment integrator. Compared to the arduous process required
                        of you to enroll in your <em>own</em> merchant account, using a payment integrator is quicker,
                        easier, and overall, more convenient – for both you <em>and</em> your consumers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why is a Payment Integrator the Best Solution for Everyone?</strong></p>
                    <p>There is no denying that the safest, most convenient, and ultimately most successful payment
                        option today is <em>cashless</em>. With the social, economic, and scientific revelations of the
                        COVID-19 pandemic, businesses big and small have to consider joining the e-commerce industry
                        completely. With the transaction process being tedious and time-consuming for providers, payment
                        integrators offer convenience, ease, and quality, without compromising the security and
                        reliability of the merchant account system. With payment integrators, providers can offer
                        consumers multiple payment options, transitioning into a fully operational e-commerce business
                        with ease and simplicity.</p>
